                Founder • Developer • Student Innovator
            </p>

            <p class="founder-text">
                Hi! I’m <strong>Sushanth</strong>, a <strong>15-year-old student developer (Entrepreneur)</strong>
                and the creator of the <strong>AP SSC Class 10 AI Tutor</strong>.
                I started learning programming and web development at a young age
                and have been actively building projects for the past
                <strong>2+ years</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="founder-text">
                As a student myself, I clearly understand the challenges faced by
                SSC students — unclear explanations, exam pressure, and lack of
                instant doubt support. This personal experience motivated me to
                build an AI-powered tutor specifically for<br>
                <strong><b>Andhra Pradesh SSC Class 10 students</b></strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="founder-text">
                This platform helps students learn concepts step-by-step, ask
                doubts anytime, and understand topics deeply in both
                <strong>Telugu and English</strong>, making learning more
                inclusive and stress-free.
            </p>

            <p class="founder-text">
                Over the last few years, I’ve worked on multiple web and AI-based
                projects, focusing on creating tools that are
                <strong>simple, practical, and genuinely useful</strong>
                for students.
            </p>

            <p class="founder-text">
                🚀 <strong>Passion areas:</strong> Education Technology,
                Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, and building tools
                that help students learn better and smarter.
            </p>

            <p class="founder-text">
                This project is just the beginning. My long-term vision is to
                continuously improve this platform based on student feedback
                and build technology that makes quality education accessible
                to everyone.
